This was part of an experimental effort to bring certificate transparency to the rustls ecosystem.
At the moment, that effort is paused.

# Regenerating sources
You will need python3 and curl.

Run `build.py` which will output a new version of `src/lib.rs`.  You can now
compare and audit.  The code is generated in deterministic order so changes
to the source should only result from upstream changes.

`build.py` also verifies the signature published alongside the list.
